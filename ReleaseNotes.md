May 18, 2017

- Complete refactor and restructure of the module and its functions.
- Each function has it's own .ps1 file.
- Use cuddeling for script blocks since it's more popular.
- A new module baseline using [Plaster](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster "Plaster").
- Use a own repository instead of my general PowerShell [repository](https://github.com/PhilipHaglund/PowerShell "repository").
- New module version order using 3 numbers (1.5.0) instead of four (1.0.1.1).
- Add `Exchange Online Protection` as an available service to connect to.
- Fixed some bugs with cached credentials.
