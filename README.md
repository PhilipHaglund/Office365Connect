# Office365Connect

Office365Connect is a module to connect to all Office 365 services that offer a way in with PowerShell.
The purpose of the module is to easily and quickly connect to all Office 365 services for a tenant using a single credential prompt. Unfortunately Azure MFA is not supported when connecting to the services.
